Semantics: HTML5 provides new semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and <aside>, 
           making it easier to structure and understand the content of a web page.

Multimedia Support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content without the need for third-party 
                    plugins. The <audio> and <video> elements allow developers to easily integrate media files into 
                    web pages.

Canvas: HTML5 introduces the <canvas> element, which provides a drawing surface for dynamic graphics and animations.
        This feature is particularly useful for creating interactive games, charts, and other graphical content without 
        relying on external plugins.

Form Controls: HTML5 enhances form controls with new input types, such as <input type="date">, <input type="email">, 
               <input type="number">, and <input type="url">. This improves user experience and allows for more accurate 
               input validation.

Local Storage: HTML5 introduces the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow web developers to store data locally 
               on the user's device. This can be useful for creating offline web applications or persisting user 
               preferences.

Web Storage: HTML5 includes the ability to store key-value pairs locally using the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, 
             providing an alternative to cookies for client-side data storage.

Geolocation API: HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that allows web applications to access the user's geographical location.
            This feature enables location-based services and enhances the functionality of location-aware web applications.

Web Workers: HTML5 introduces the concept of web workers, which are background scripts that can run concurrently with the
             main JavaScript thread. This allows for improved performance and responsiveness in web applications by 
             offloading computationally intensive tasks to separate threads.

Responsive Design: HTML5 encourages the use of responsive design techniques with features like media queries and flexible
                   box layouts (Flexbox) to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

Compatibility with Mobile Devices: HTML5 is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including smartphones and 
                                   tablets, making it well-suited for mobile web development.
